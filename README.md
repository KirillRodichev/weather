## Weather React App
Simple app that shows local weather forecast

### Api key
You'll find out that `server.js` requests the [API Яндекс.Погода](https://yandex.ru/dev/weather/doc/dg/concepts/about.html/) using `YANDEX_API_KEY`, that refers to .env file stored in a server directory. Because this key is private I cannot share it. To create the key you'll have to follow some simple steps described at the link above. There are multiple API tariffs, select "test" and you'll be fine.
